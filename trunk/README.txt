Integrate Pardot with WordPress: easily track visitors, embed forms and dynamic content in pages and posts, or use the forms or dynamic content widgets.

== Description ==

Say hello to marketing automation simplicity! With a single login, your self-hosted WordPress installation will be securely connected with Pardot. With the selection of your campaign, you'll be able to track visitors and work with forms and dynamic content without touching a single line of code. You can use the widget to place a form or dynamic content anywhere a sidebar appears, or embed them in a page or post using a shortcode or the Pardot button on the Visual Editor's toolbar.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `pardot-for-wordpress/trunk` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress Admin area and search for Pardot.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings > Pardot Settings and authenticate with Salesforce SSO.
4. Select your campaign (for tracking code usage).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I authenticate with Salesforce SSO? =

In order to use Salesforce SSO authentication, you **must** create a connected application for the plugin in your Salesforce org.  


1. Navigate to [App Manager](https://login.salesforce.com/lightning/setup/NavigationMenus/home).  
1. On the top right, click the "New Connected App" button.
1. Enter an app name, API name, and contact email of your choice.
1. Click the "Enable OAuth Settings" toggle.
1. Enter a Callback URL to allow Salesforce to redirect users back to your Pardot plugin settings page. The URL should look similar to: `https://[YourWordpressDomainHere]/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pardot`.
1. Add "Access Pardot Services (pardot_api)" and "Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)" to your selected OAuth scopes.
1. Save your connected application. A new page will appear with the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.
1. Enter your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, and Pardot Business Unit ID into the Pardot WordPress settings screen. To find the Pardot Business Unit ID, go to Salesforce Setup and enter "Pardot Account Setup" in the Quick Find box. Your Pardot Business Unit ID begins with "0Uv" and is 18 characters long. If you cannot access the Pardot Account Setup information, ask your Salesforce Administrator to provide you with the Pardot Business Unit ID.
1. Click "Save Settings".
1. When the page reloads, click "Authenticate with Salesforce". Enter your Salesforce credentials in the popup that appears. 

You should then see Authentication Status change from "Not Authenticated" to "Authenticated".
= How can I use the shortcodes without the Visual Editor? =

Two simple shortcodes are available for use.

**Form Shortcode**

	`[pardot-form id="{Form ID}" title="{Form Name}" class="" width="100%" height="500" querystring=""]`

Use `[pardot-form]` with at least the `id` parameter. For instance, `[pardot-form id="1" title="Title"]` renders my Pardot form with an ID of 1.

Optional parameters:

The `title` parameter is included when using the toolbar button, but it's not required for display. There is no default.

The `class` parameter allows you to add additonal classes to the iframe element. There is no default, but the class `pardotform` is now automatically added, regardless of any additional classes.

The `width` parameter will set the width of the iframe in pixels or percentage. For example, "500", "500px", and "80%" are all valid. The default is 100%.

The `height` parameter will set the height of the iframe in pixels only. For example, "500" or "500px" are valid. The default is 500px.

The `querystring` parameter appends an arbitrary string to the end of the form's iframe source. This is helpful for passing data directly into the form. You can also do this with filters (see below).

**Dynamic Content Shortcode**

	`[pardot-dynamic-content id="{Dynamic Content ID}" default="{Non-JavaScript Content}"]`

Use `[pardot-dynamic-content]` with at least the `id` parameter.

The `default` parameter is used for accessibility. Whatever is placed here is wrapped in `<noscript>` tags and is shown only to users who have JavaScript disabled. By default, it will automatically be your "Default Content" as designated in Pardot. So,

	`[pardot-dynamic-content id="1" default="My default content."]`

would render something like:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://go.pardot.com/dcjs/99999/99/dc.js"></script><noscript>My default content.</noscript>

...which would show the dynamic content to users with JavaScript enabled, and 'My default content' to users with it disabled. Note that, due to the way the WordPress Visual Editor works, HTML tags for the parameter will be URL encoded to avoid strange formatting.

= How do I change my campaign? =

Simply choose another campaign in Settings > Pardot Settings and click 'Save Settings'.

= Some of my form is cut off. What should I do? =

Since every WordPress theme is different, embedded forms won’t always automatically fit. You’ll want to make a Pardot Layout Template specifically for your WordPress theme:

1. Go to <a href="https://pi.pardot.com/form" target="_blank">Forms</a> in Pardot. Find and edit the form that needs updating.
1. Click ahead to the 'Look and Feel' step of the wizard and select the 'Styles' tab.
1. Set 'Label Alignment' to 'Above' and click 'Confirm and Save.'.
1. Click the link to the layout template being used by the form.
1. Edit the layout template and add the following to the <code><head></code> section of the template:

	&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
		&#35;pardot-form input.text, &#35;pardot-form textarea {
			width: 150px;
		}
	&lt;/style&gt;

A width of 150px is just a starting point. Adjust this value until it fits on your page and add additional styles as you see fit. For styling help, reference our <a href="http://www.pardot.com/help/faqs/forms/basic-css-for-forms" target="_blank">Basic CSS for Forms</a> page.

= I just added a form or dynamic content, and it's not showing up to select it yet. =

Go to Settings > Pardot Settings and click 'Reset Cache'. This should reinitialize and update your Pardot content.

= The editor popup doesn't work, and I know that my WordPress installation is a little different. =

As of version 1.4, developers can now deal with various directory configurations that would previously cause the plugin to break. This is due to the plugin not being able to find `wp-load.php`.

To fix it, add a new file called `pardot-custom-wp-load.php` to the `plugins/pardot/includes` directory (this will never be overridden by updates). In that file, define a constant that gives the absolute path to your `wp-load.php` file. For instance:

	define('PARDOT_WP_LOAD', '/path/to/wp-load.php');

= Filters =

	pardot_form_embed_code_[Form ID]

Filter the entire embed code for a given form. A common usage for this is conditionally appending a query string. So, for instance, the following will filter the embed code for form #545 and append an arbitrary parameter along with the post ID of the page being viewed:

	function pardot_custom_append_querystring($body_html) {
		return preg_replace( '/src="([^"]+)"/', 'src="$1?this=that&postID=' . get_the_ID() . '"', $body_html );
	}

	add_filter( 'pardot_form_embed_code_54796', 'pardot_custom_append_querystring' );

You can apply any conditional logic you want. For instance, this will append the same information, but only if you're on the "About" page:

	function pardot_custom_append_querystring($body_html) {
		if ( is_page('About') ) {
			$body_html = preg_replace( '/src="([^"]+)"/', 'src="$1?this=that&postID=' . get_the_ID() . '"', $body_html );
		}
		return $body_html;
	}

	add_filter( 'pardot_form_embed_code_54796', 'pardot_custom_append_querystring' );

	pardot_https_regex

Filter the regular expression used to find URLs to be converted to https://go.pardot.com. This is only used when "Use HTTPS?" is checked in the settings. You may want to filter this regex if you find it's not properly capturing and converting your URLs.

	function pardot_custom_filter_https_regex() {
		return "/(http|https|ftp|ftps)\:\/\/[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,63}(\/\S[^'\"]*)?/";
	}

	add_filter( 'pardot_https_regex', 'pardot_custom_filter_https_regex' );
